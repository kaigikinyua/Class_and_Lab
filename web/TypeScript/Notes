----Modules----
Before you work with Modules
make sure that you change the 'module' json key in tsconfig
from 'commonJS' to 'es2015' 
It will require that you use modern browsers in order for the site to properly work
This can be bypassed by using webpack to bundle *.js files into 1 big gigantic file

---dynamic style editing----
Typescript does not have 'element.style' instead it uses
'element.setAttribute('attribute','css decription')'
example
    elementx.setAttribute('style','display:none');
