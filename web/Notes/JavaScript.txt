#Parsing values
 parseInt(value,base)
	-value is the variable or the hardcoded value that you would like to parse
	-base is the current base level you want your value to be parsed to
	-- example [ parseInt("FF",16) will give result 255] since the value 'FF'
	is parsed to become an integer of base 10 from hexadecimal (base 16)
